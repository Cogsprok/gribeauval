Simple Java Plugin Module Framework

A small framework project done in a short amount of time for a school project.
Provided an excuse to study existing plug-in and modular frameworks, as well as dig into class loaders and expand my Java skills a bit beyond the standards required for basic courseork and certification. 

There are other frameworks and specifications that serve a similar purpose, but weren't exactly what I had in mind.
The framework still needs a lot of work and testing, but is basically functional, facilitating access and loading of "Modules" by placing JAR files in a specified folder.
